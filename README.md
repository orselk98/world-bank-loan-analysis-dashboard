#  World Bank IBRD Loan Analysis Dashboard (Excel Project)

This is an Excel-based dashboard project analyzing global loan data from the **World Bank IBRD (International Bank for Reconstruction and Development)**.

The dataset provides the latest snapshot of loans and guarantees issued to countries worldwide, including loan statuses, disbursements, repayments, and more — giving insight into the **scale and flow of global development finance**.

---

##  Project Overview

**Goal:**  
To analyze, visualize, and summarize global lending trends using only **Microsoft Excel** — including **Power Pivot**, **PivotTables**, **DAX**, and dynamic visualizations — and deliver a polished dashboard for stakeholders.

##  Workflow Summary

### 1️ Data Source

- Source: [World Bank IBRD Loan Snapshot (April 2025)](https://financesone.worldbank.org/ibrd-statement-of-loans-and-guarantees-latest-available-snapshot/DS00047)
- Format: CSV with thousands of rows of project-level data

### 2️ Initial Steps

- Cleaned missing values (countries, amounts, statuses)
- Verified and formatted currency fields
- Standardized column names
- Removed records with no financial significance

### 3️ Analysis (Power Pivot + DAX)

Key measures created:
- Total loan amounts
- Disbursed vs undisbursed balances
- Remaining loan amounts (Due + Undisbursed)
- Disbursement rate (disbursed ÷ total original loan)
- Repayment amounts
- Average loan size
- Loan trends over time

Used **Power Pivot** to build a data model and define relationships (e.g., countries ↔ projects).

### 4️ Dashboard Design

Built an interactive Excel dashboard with:
- Key metrics: Borrowing countries, active loans, disbursement rates, avg. loan size
- Top borrowers by total loan, current debt, and remaining balance
- Disbursement performance by country
- Regional breakdown of lending
- Time series trend: Loan approvals since 1970
- Slicers for timeline and region (interactive)
